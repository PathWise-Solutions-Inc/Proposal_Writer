# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Proposal Writer is an AI-powered proposal intelligence platform designed to revolutionize how organizations respond to RFPs. The project is currently in the planning phase with comprehensive documentation but no implementation yet.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains product documentation and research:
- `product-requirements-document.md` - Comprehensive PRD defining the full vision
- `Research/` - Market analysis, technical research, and value proposition strategy
- No code implementation exists yet

## Key Product Concepts

### Core Functionality
1. **RFP Analysis Engine** - Automated extraction of evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics from RFPs
2. **Client Intelligence System** - Automated research across multiple sources
3. **Adaptive Proposal Builder** - Drag-and-drop document structuring inspired by NovelCraft
4. **AI Content Generation** - Context-aware proposal content using Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4
5. **Compliance Tracker** - Automated requirement tracking and verification

### Target Architecture (from PRD)
- Microservices architecture with Node.js backend
- React/Vue frontend with drag-and-drop capabilities
- PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for documents
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- AWS/Azure cloud infrastructure

## Development Status

### Current Phase: MVP Development - Week 0 Complete âœ…

**Completed:**
- âœ… Project foundation and structure
- âœ… Monorepo setup with Lerna
- âœ… Frontend application skeleton (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- âœ… Backend microservices structure
- âœ… Docker configuration
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Development environment setup

**In Progress:**
- ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Authentication & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
  - Next: User authentication system implementation

**Upcoming Phases:**
- Phase 2: RFP Analysis Engine (Week 3-6) - Core MVP feature
- Phase 3: Proposal Builder (Week 7-10)
- Phase 4: Compliance & Export (Week 11-12)
- Phase 5: Client Research (Week 13-14)
- Phase 6: Testing & Launch (Week 15-16)

### Progress Tracking
Detailed progress is tracked in `/Project_Management/MVP_Development_Plan.md`

### Implementation Guidelines
When implementing:
- Start with MVP features defined in Section 8 of the PRD
- Follow the technical recommendations in the technical research report
- Consider the value propositions outlined in the strategy document
- Refer to the MVP Development Plan for current priorities

## Key Technical Decisions (from research)

### AI/NLP Integration
- Primary: Claude 3.5 Sonnet API for content generation
- Alternative: GPT-4 for specific use cases
- Consider DeepRFP or AutoRFP.ai for specialized RFP processing

### Frontend Framework
- Recommended: React with react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop
- Alternative: Vue.js with Vue.Draggable

### Backend Services
- Node.js with Express/Fastify for API services
- Python microservices for AI/ML operations
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async processing

## Important Context

- The platform targets mid-market B2B services companies (50-500 employees)
- Initial focus on IT services vertical
- SaaS model with $49-299/user/month pricing
- Key differentiator: First automated RFP evaluation rubric generator
- Success metric: 40% average win rate improvement for users

## GitHub Integration

The repository is hosted at: https://github.com/PathWise-Solutions-Inc/Proposal_Writer
- Uses main branch as default
- Public repository for community collaboration
