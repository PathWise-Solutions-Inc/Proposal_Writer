# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Proposal Writer is an AI-powered proposal intelligence platform designed to revolutionize how organizations respond to RFPs. The project is currently in the planning phase with comprehensive documentation but no implementation yet.

The repository contains product documentation and research:
- `product-requirements-document.md` - Comprehensive PRD defining the full vision
- `Research/` - Market analysis, technical research, and value proposition strategy
- No code implementation exists yet

## Key Product Concepts

### Core Functionality
1. **RFP Analysis Engine** - Automated extraction of evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics from RFPs
2. **Client Intelligence System** - Automated research across multiple sources
3. **Adaptive Proposal Builder** - Drag-and-drop document structuring inspired by NovelCraft
4. **AI Content Generation** - Context-aware proposal content using Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4
5. **Compliance Tracker** - Automated requirement tracking and verification

### Target Architecture (from PRD)
- Microservices architecture with Node.js backend

### Progress Tracking
Detailed progress is tracked in `/Project_Management/MVP_Development_Plan.md`

### Recent Technical Achievements (August 2025)

**RFP Upload System - Phase 2 Core Implementation:**
- Full-stack file upload with FormData handling and multipart support
- Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for RFP analysis results
- Drag-and-drop UI with Material-UI components and file validation
- Database schema with JSONB storage for complex analysis data
- Bull queue integration with Redis for async RFP processing
- OpenRouter API integration for AI-powered RFP analysis

**Development Environment Fixes:**
- Fixed Vite proxy configuration for API routing (`/api` â†’ `localhost:8002`)
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in microservices
- Created demo authentication bypass for testing workflows
- Implemented comprehensive Playwright test coverage

**Service Architecture:**
- RFP Analysis Service: `localhost:8002` (Node.js + TypeORM + OpenRouter)
- Auth Service: `localhost:8001` (JWT + refresh tokens + CSRF protection)
- Frontend: `localhost:3000` (React + TypeScript + Vite + Material-UI)

### Implementation Guidelines
When implementing:
- Start with MVP features defined in Section 8 of the PRD
- Follow the technical recommendations in the technical research report
- Consider the value propositions outlined in the strategy document
- Refer to the MVP Development Plan for current priorities

## Key Technical Decisions (from research)

### AI/NLP Integration
- **Now Using: OpenRouter API** - Unified access to multiple AI models
  - Primary model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter
  - Alternative models available: GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.
  - Cost-effective pay-as-you-go pricing
  - API Key configured in `.env` as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Consider DeepRFP or AutoRFP.ai for specialized RFP processing

### Frontend Framework
- Recommended: React with react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop
- Alternative: Vue.js with Vue.Draggable

### Backend Services
- Node.js with Express/Fastify for API services
- Python microservices for AI/ML operations
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async processing

## Important Context

- The platform targets mid-market B2B services companies (50-500 employees)
- Initial focus on IT services vertical
- SaaS model with $49-299/user/month pricing
- Key differentiator: First automated RFP evaluation rubric generator
- Success metric: 40% average win rate improvement for users

## GitHub Integration

The repository is hosted at: https://github.com/PathWise-Solutions-Inc/Proposal_Writer
- Uses main branch as default
- Public repository for community collaboration

## Common Development Issues and Solutions

### TypeScript Unused Import Errors
When you encounter TypeScript errors about unused imports (e.g., `'OneToMany' is declared but its value is never read`):
- **Always remove unused imports** before committing or running services
- **Use your editor's "Organize Imports" feature** or manually clean up imports
- **Common in TypeORM entities**: When copying entity boilerplate, remove unused decorators like `OneToMany` if not defining relationships
- **This blocks service startup**: The auth-service and other TypeScript services will crash on startup with these errors

### Running Services
When testing the application, ensure all required services are running:
1. **Auth Service** (port 8001): `cd services/auth-service && npm run dev`
2. **RFP Analysis Service** (port 8002): `cd services/rfp-analysis-service && npm run dev`
3. **Frontend** (port 3000): `cd packages/web-app && npm run dev`
4. **Redis** (for queues): `redis-server` or via Docker
5. **PostgreSQL** (for database): Ensure database is running

## Testing Tools

### Playwright MCP
The Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is available for automated browser testing and UI/UX validation. Use this tool whenever:
- New UI components or pages are added
- UI/UX changes need to be tested
- End-to-end user workflows need validation
- Visual regression testing is required
- Cross-browser compatibility needs verification

Key capabilities:
- Browser automation for testing user interactions
- Screenshot capture for visual verification
- Form filling and button clicking automation
- Navigation and page state validation
- Console message and network request monitoring

Example use cases for Proposal Writer:
- Testing the drag-and-drop proposal builder interface
- Validating RFP upload and parsing workflows
- Verifying authentication flows and protected routes
- Testing responsive design across different viewports
- Ensuring compliance tracker UI updates correctly
