Hey there,

I'd like to make an app that allows us to create custom proposals based on the RFPs or requests that come in.

Action items and functionality needed:

- The app should analyze the RFP and create a rubric that evaluates anything we writeâ€”essentially, guidelines for our proposals.
- It should be able to research the client and gather information on them.
- I want it to use a framework we create, or something similar to the software called NovelCraft, where the proposal structure is built out and can be clicked through, changed, and rearranged. This will allow us to move different parts of the proposal around easily.
- Once the structure is finalized, the app should pull together research, information about our company, services, and case studies, and auto-generate the proposal draft based on the chosen structure.
- It should also allow the user to edit the proposal, make changes, and download it as a markdown file.

Let me know your thoughts or any questions about how to approach this.

Thanks,
